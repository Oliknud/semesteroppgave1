            <h2>Cosmology</h2>

            <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what 
                we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations
                and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars 
                to travel by.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, 
                to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
            <img src="img/heart.png" alt="image of heart" class="mobileImg">
            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are 
                offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, 
                thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the 
                history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin 
                and the first heart transplant. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals 
                in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
            </p>

            <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
            <img src="img/ai.png" alt="image of vr painting" class="mobileImg">
            <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future. 
                From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say 
                hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
            </p>

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <img src="img/evo.png" alt="image of skeletons" class="mobileImg">
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come 
                from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring 
                and understanding our place in this world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also 
                take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a 
                number of dinosaurs too.
